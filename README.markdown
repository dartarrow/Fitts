# Fitts

Fitts is a GUI application for acquiring user input data to be analysed with the Fitt's law and learning curve theory through predefined tasks. Originaly developed to be used with an interactive blackboard and custom hacked keyboard (allowing keys to be a few meters apart) to get input for longer than usual movements.
For a simple on the go analysis it uses public domain MINPACK routines translated from FORTRAN to Java by Steve Verrill

## Features

	- User profiles for individual test subjects
	- Various predefined, customizable and randomizable tasks for mouse/touchscreen and keyboard input
	- Repeating tasks for learning curve data

## Installation

Just put all the files in a directory and run FittsMain.java
